# Sales Insights Project

This repository showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using Power BI and SQL. Guided by the tutorials from the YouTube channel "Codebasics," I've utilized various techniques such as data extraction, transformation, cleaning, filtering, and dashboard creation to derive meaningful insights from a sales dataset.

## Dashboard Link

You can view the interactive dashboard created for this project by following this [Power BI Dashboard Link](https://app.powerbi.com/links/8QvTvS3vLi?ctid=29bebd42-f1ff-4c3d-9688-067e3460dc1f&pbi_source=linkShare).

## Dataset Used

The sales dataset used in this project was provided by the YouTube channel "Codebasics," containing detailed information on sales transactions, markets, customers, products and date.


## Key Features

- **Setting up MySQL Server**: I created and configured a MySQL server to host the sales dataset.
  
- **Loading Dataset into MySQL**: I loaded the sales dataset into the MySQL server, ensuring proper data storage and management.

- **Connecting MySQL Server to Power BI**: I established a connection between the MySQL server and the Power BI application, enabling seamless data access.

- **Creating Table Relations**: I established relationships between the tables in the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient analysis.

- **Implementing Star Schema**: I organized the database tables into a star schema to optimize query performance and facilitate analysis.

- **Data Cleaning**: I performed data cleaning operations, such as removing 0 and -1 values from the sales amount column and eliminating duplicate values to enhance data quality.

- **Creating Normalized Currency Column**: I created a new column called "Normalized Currency" that converted USD values in the sales amount column into INR values, while leaving INR values unchanged.

- **Defining Custom Measures**: I created a custom measure combining the sum of revenue and sum of quantity to derive meaningful insights into sales performance.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Utilizing Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard to visualize the revenue trend and other key metrics, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights at a glance.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- SQL

## Future Improvements

In future iterations of this project, I aim to enhance the dashboard visuals, incorporate advanced analytics techniques, and integrate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis of sales performance.
